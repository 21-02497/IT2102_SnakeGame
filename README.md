# üêç Snake Game Program



## üìù Project Description


The goal of Snake is to create a snake as long as possible. This is achieved by guiding the
snake to an apple on the game board. The snake cannot stop moving, and dies whenever
it hits something (excluding apples). Because the snake is growing longer and longer as
the game progresses, it gets increasingly difficult to avoid collisions with the snake itself.
The player can change the direction of the head of the snake by using the arrow keys. At the
start of the game, there is always an apple somewhere on the board. If the snake eats an
apple, the snake becomes one cell longer per step. A new apple is placed at
a random location.


## üéÆ How to Run the Snake Game Program?

**Installing**
1. To use these exercise files, you must have the following installed:
	- Python 3
2. Clone this repository into your local machine using the terminal (Mac), CMD (Windows), or a GUI tool like SourceTree.

**Running**

Specify the file path for the .py file in this line:

```python
def restart(event):
    window.destroy()
    os.startfile(r'FilePathHere')
```



## Rules
1. Snake has to move either forward, left or right.
2. Snake dies when it hits a wall or itself.
3. For every eaten fruit, snake's length and player's score increases by 1 and a new fruit is generated on a random unoccupied place.

## üíª Controls
1. The game begins with snake of length 3.
2. Keys `Up`, `Down`, `Right`, and `Left` are used to navigate.
3. The Score of the game is displayed at the top of the game.
4. Click `Esc` to quit and Press `R` to retry after a game over.

## Concepts Used

* Encapsulation - the concept of bundling data and methods within a single unit, by creating classes we implemented encapsulation
* Inheritance - allows us to define a class that inherits all the methods and properties from another class. by calling and using different function we implemented      	         inheritance



## Self Assesment

The group evaluated the system using the provided grading rubric, which resulted in the following:
